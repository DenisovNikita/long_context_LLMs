 The master’s thesis has a logical structure. The first parts are dedicated to literature overview, thus the theoretical result of the work is quite obvious: using literature analysis and practical examples overview, the author systematized and structured theoretical approaches, clarified different definitions and theoretical concepts. The next parts describe research methodology: sample, methods and data analysis and findings from empirical study. The last part of the thesis is discussion of findings and results.                                                                                                                       
Quality of analytical approach and quality of offered solution to the research objectives. Adequacy of objectives coverage; ability to formulate and convey the research problem; ability to offer options for its solution; application of the latest trends in relevant research are for the set objectives.
The quality of analytical approach is very high. To achieve the goal the author put a certain list of supporting tasks, namely formulated several research questions that guide the empirical research.  The author showed the ability to analyse the research problem and formulated tasks for empirical research correlated with research questions.
Quality of data gathering and description. Quality of selecting research tools and methods; data validity adequacy; adequacy of used data for chosen research tools and methods; completeness and relevance of the list of references.
The methodology part is very clear and understandable. The quality of selecting research tools and method is high and data validity is adequacy.
